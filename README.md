#About

[Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org/) for the JVM.

#Architecture

Thanks to the amazing [IKVM project](http://www.ikvm.net/) it is possible to use the great [ObjectWeb ASM](http://asm.objectweb.org/)
library from boo running on mono/ms.net to emit native java bytecode that
can be executed by any compliant java virtual machine.
